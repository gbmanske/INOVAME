Optimizing adder efficiency is crucial for improving arithmetic units in AI hardware, enabling faster and more energy-efficient accelerators. This project explores different adder architectures, including Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA), and Kogge-Stone Adder, evaluating their performance based on metrics obtained from logical and physical synthesis. The architectures are implemented in SystemVerilog, allowing for the configuration of some design parameters. After the designs are simulated, they undergo the complete logical and physical synthesis process, resulting in the generation of the GDS2 layout. By comparing metrics such as area, delay, and power consumption, the study aims to identify the most efficient implementations. The insights from this analysis will contribute to future efforts in optimizing neural network hardware accelerators.
